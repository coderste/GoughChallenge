This repository contains a Basic WordPress theme that adds a shortcode to the website to call a Location form where Users can enter there location and then a second location and find the distances between the two.

This WordPress Theme uses [GMaps](https://hpneo.github.io/gmaps/) (don't worry we already register this script on the site inside `functions.php`) to make for easier use of Google Maps API.

Use the Shortcode [LocationForm] to call the User input fields

Feautres:
---
* Allows users to enter just there post code to find out the distance between two locations
* Shows the user the best route to take to get to there location
